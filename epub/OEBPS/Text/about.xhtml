    <p class="info">Mark Twain is most noted for his novels, <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> (1876), and its sequel, <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> (1885), the latter often called "the Great American Novel." Among dozens of titles, some of his works include <em>The Innocents Abroad, A Tramp Abroad, Roughing It, Life on the Mississippi, The Prince and the Pauper, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,</em> and many more.</p>

    <p class="info">Huck fakes his own death to escape from his abusive drunken father, and shortly thereafter encounters the runaway slave Jim. The pair embark upon a journey to freedom, riding a raft down the Mississippi River, experiencing many adventures and encountering numerous colorful characters. The story is as many-layered as an onion; it may be read simply as a boy’s adventure story, but it is imbued with (sometimes subversive) humor, sizzles with satire, and might even be considered as an allegory.</p>

    <p class="info"><em>Huckleberry Finn</em> has been the center of controversy since its first publication, with some critics then and now decrying its coarse language, bad taste, and abhorrent lifestyle; bans then and now by some libraries and schools; and several sanitized versions which replace the infamous ubiquitous “N-word” with some Politically Correct term.</p>

    <p class="info">Some have called it the first Great American Novel, and the book has become required reading in many schools throughout the United States. Ernest Hemingway wrote: “All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.” But he also notes “If you read it, you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating.”</p>

    <p class="info">The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. By satirizing Southern antebellum society that was already a quarter-century in the past by the time of publication, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature.<br />
