version notes:

Adventures of HUCKLEBERRY FINN
by Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens) (1835-1910)
with 174 Illustrations by E. W. Kemble (1861-1933)
and 13 illustrations by James Harley (no biographical info available)
First published 1885

The text of this book is in the public domain world-wide because the author died more than 100 years ago. 

Mark Twain is most noted for his novels, “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” (1876), and its sequel, “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” the latter often called "the Great American Novel." Among dozens of titles, some of his works include “The Innocents Abroad,” “A Tramp Abroad,” “Roughing It,” “Life on the Mississippi,” “The Prince and the Pauper,” “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,” and many more.

Huck fakes his own death to escape from his abusive drunken father, and shortly thereafter encounters the runaway slave Jim. The pair embark upon a journey to freedom, riding a raft down the Mississippi River, experiencing many adventures and encountering numerous colorful characters. The story is as many-layered as an onion; it may be read as simply a boy’s adventure story, but it is imbued with (sometimes subversive) humor, sizzles with satire, and might even be considered as an allegory.

“Huckleberry Finn” has been the center of controversy since its first publication, with some critics then and now decrying its coarse language, bad taste, and abhorrent lifestyle; bans then and now by some libraries and schools; and several sanitized versions which replace the infamous ubiquitous “N-word” with some Politically Correct term.

The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. By satirizing Southern antebellum society that was already a quarter-century in the past by the time of publication, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature.

Text based on the Project Gutenberg plain-text transcription; I formatted curly quotes, emdashes, and restored italics. 174 half-page illustrations; code borrowed from Jellby's edition of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" to wrap the text around chapter-header images. (Thank you Jellby, you always seem to have solutions to my problems.) Embedded decorative font for titling and initial caps. No drop-caps. 

Version 2 has additional 5000-word segment linked to Chapter 16.

This is not a “sanitized” version, you will encounter the “n-word”. That said, enjoy the read!
